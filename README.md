# Humble Superhero API

## Overview

The Humble Superhero API is a celebration of team collaboration and individual contributions, recognizing that every team member is a superhero in their own unique way. This API allows tracking and discovering superheroes based on their special abilities and, most importantly, their humility scores.

## Features

- Add new superheroes with their powers and humility scores
- Retrieve a list of superheroes sorted by humility
- Input validation to ensure data quality
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Optional React frontend for real-time interaction

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture

The application is built using NestJS and follows a clean architecture pattern:

```
src/
├── superheroes/
│   ├── dto/
│   │   └── create-superhero.dto.ts
│   ├── superheroes.controller.ts
│   ├── superheroes.service.ts
│   └── superheroes.module.ts
├── main.ts
└── app.module.ts
```

### API Endpoints

- `POST /superheroes`

  - Add a new superhero
  - Required fields: name, superpower, humility score (1-10)
  - Includes input validation

- `GET /superheroes`
  - Retrieve all superheroes
  - Automatically sorted by humility score in descending order

### Data Storage

Currently implements an in-memory database solution for superhero storage, making it easy to set up and test while maintaining flexibility for future database integration.

### Testing

Comprehensive test suite covering:

- Input validation
- CRUD operations
- Edge cases
- Basic error handling
